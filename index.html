    <h2>Playtesting Insights</h2>
    <p>We conducted five rounds of playtesting across different phases of the game's development. Each round provided valuable feedback that guided our design and implementation decisions. Click on each phase to learn more:</p>
    
    <div class="playtest-phases">
      <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Digital Phase 1</h3>
        <div id="phase1" class="phase-content">
          <p>At this stage, we had a basic map and a movable player character using arrow keys or WASD.</p>
          <h4>Feedback:</h4>
          <p>Testers responded positively to the map layout, but the common feedback was the lack of gameplay mechanics.</p>
          <h4>Decision:</h4>
          <p>We planned to add at least two core mechanics before the next round of testing.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Digital Phase 2</h3>
        <div id="phase2" class="phase-content">
          <p>In this phase, we implemented partial ghost and key mechanics. However, there were no lock or door systems yet, so keys would simply respawn after being picked up.</p>
          <h4>Feedback:</h4>
          <p>Testers suggested improving the ghost behavior, adding doors, and including start and end screens.</p>
          <h4>Decision:</h4>
          <p>We prioritized polishing ghost and key mechanics first before introducing locks/doors, and started planning to add sound effects like walking and ambient sounds.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Alpha Testing Phase</h3>
        <div id="phase3" class="phase-content">
          <p>By alpha, ghost mechanics were functional, and we introduced temporary lock and door systems to allow the game to end after collecting keys. We also fixed key spawning so keys would only appear in accessible zones, not inside walls or furniture.</p>
          <h4>Feedback:</h4>
          <p>Testers requested a tutorial/start screen and an improved ending.</p>
          <h4>Decision:</h4>
          <p>Focus next on user interface elements like start and end screens, and enhance lighting to improve the atmosphere.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Beta Testing Phase</h3>
        <div id="phase4" class="phase-content">
          <p>In this phase, we added pixel-art style locks and doors, along with sound effects for unlocking. A health bar and red lighting effects were introduced to visually reflect damage taken from ghosts. We also added sound effects for damage and key collection.</p>
          <h4>Feedback:</h4>
          <p>Testers appreciated the improvements but wanted more interactivity.</p>
          <h4>Decision:</h4>
          <p>We decided to work on a tutorial screen and implement a new box mechanic, allowing players to block or hide from ghosts.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Final Testing Phase</h3>
        <div id="phase5" class="phase-content">
          <p>The final version included the box-pushing mechanic, a tutorial screen, and an ending scene to complete the game's story.</p>
          <h4>Feedback:</h4>
          <p>Some players suggested improvements to the health bar UI, enabling mouse interaction (as using "E" with WASD was difficult), adding more levels, and fixing a bug where keys sometimes spawned under boxes.</p>
          <h4>Decision:</h4>
          <p>These insights will guide potential future updates and polish.</p>

        <h3>üåü What We Did Well</h3>
        <div class="reflection-content">
          <p>One thing our team did really well was starting early and having thorough discussions about our game concept. We held 2‚Äì3 meetings early in the process to align on the type of game we wanted to build, assign roles, choose tools like version control, and set clear goals. This early planning helped us stay organized and ensured everyone knew their responsibilities from the beginning.</p>
          
          <p>Evidence of this includes our initial prototype, which was completed early, and the detailed meeting notes we took during our planning sessions. Additionally, we maintained strong communication throughout the project, regularly updating each other on progress and challenges.</p>

        <h3>üéØ Future Improvements</h3>
        <div class="reflection-content">
          <p>If we had another 2 weeks to work on this game, the following would be the top 3 priority items:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add more levels to increase the difficulty</li>
            <li>Add more types of ghosts/enemies with unique behavior</li>
            <li>Inventory system - players can store more keys, healing items, and tools like a flashlight</li>

          <li>Lots of bugs which lead to more bugs when fixed</li>
          <li>Did not have consistent meeting schedule, leading to unproportionate work distributions some weeks</li>
